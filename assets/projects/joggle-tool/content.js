        On the airplane, the tabbed sheet metal shown in the picture holds the canopy bubble to its frame. Each tab needs to have a joggle to fit around & clamp onto the polycarbonate bubble. However, the bubble varies in thickness, so the sheet metal tabs are cut in different widths and have to be joggled to different heights.
        <br/><br/>
        The design is simple - a toe holds the tab in place for the steel ram to be pressed into the sheet metal. The recess the metal is pressed into can have shims, allowing the joggle's height to adjust for the uneven polycarbonate.

        To build this, I machined 3 different bars to make wide versions of the base, toe, & ram (cut from mild steel for extra strength). To account for the different widths, I sliced the machined bars down to fit each size.
        <br/>
        The results are great! The bends came out smooth & pretty much parallel - not much more to ask for.
