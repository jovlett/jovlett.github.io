            This design can be used on a Kurt machine vise or a T-slotted table to position stock repeatably. It's pretty sick!<br/><br/>
            The original concept (below) was only going to have one link, but I added another for flexibility:

            </div>
            <p>
            Tightening bolts on each joint should lock it together. There's a little hole+keyed tab for the stop rod that clamps onto the rod when the screw is tight to hopefully not mar it up. <br/><br/>
            It's also modular which is nice. If needed, I can make more links for even more reach.<br/><br/>
            To be machined soon!<br/><br/>

            This is the start of a prop guillotine for a haunted house, and we want to simulate a beheading. This works with an actor doing a plank underneath a fake body. When the blade hits the neck, the actor lies down while the body stays on the table, severing the head. <br/><br/>
            Revisiting the design after building a little, it's pretty thick. I may chop off 6-12" from a side and see how that looks. I forgot to model gussets/support in CAD, but the frame seems sturdy enough so far.

            9/16/22 - Frame update - we built it out a little more and found a wine rack thatâ€™ll work great as the table.<br/><br/>
            With the frame finished, all we made today was the blade/blade shuttle and the headrest.
            The blade shuttle is built with a board with vertical "guides" to keep it in line. The blade itself is painted poster board. The screws directly into the poster board tore out, so we had to add a little tape across the top to reinforce it.
            The headrest is made with 2 boards, the top & bottom the bottom has a cutout section that breaks away with Velcro. It allows the actor's head to move through the headrest, away from the fake body on top. The blade covers the hole that the breakaway piece leaves, making a (hopefully) convincing execution.

            On the airplane, the tabbed sheet metal shown in the picture holds the canopy bubble to its frame. Each tab needs to have a joggle to fit around & clamp onto the polycarbonate bubble. However, the bubble varies in thickness, so the sheet metal tabs are cut in different widths and have to be joggled to different heights.
            <br/><br/>
            The design is simple - a toe holds the tab in place for the steel ram to be pressed into the sheet metal. The recess the metal is pressed into can have shims, allowing the joggle's height to adjust for the uneven polycarbonate.

            To build this, I machined 3 different bars to make wide versions of the base, toe, & ram (cut from mild steel for extra strength). To account for the different widths, I sliced the machined bars down to fit each size.
            <br/>
            The results are great! The bends came out smooth & pretty much parallel - not much more to ask for.

            Finished up our last off-season event this weekend - I couldn't have asked for a better way to retire this machine.<br/>
            After rebuilding the front of the robot, adding intake hard stops, and switching out the tracker camera mount, the team competed at Capital City Classic, going 5-7 against multiple world finalists in the bracket.
            Our first couple of matches went poorly as we tried to sort out a distance-based shooting strategy that changed flywheel speeds to tweak the shot trajectory. Mid-match isn't a great time to do shooter tuning, so we fell back to a pre-set speed and started raking in some wins. Over the course of the event (out of 36 other teams) we started at 29th, peaked at 8th, and ended qualifiers at 11th place. Pretty good!
            <br/><br/>

            As the captains of Alliance #8 in the quarterfinals, we picked two other two teams (701 Vikingbots and 7528 Nuts and Bolts) to compete against the top 3 teams in California (Alliance #1). 
            <br/>Sure we got curb-stomped, but we won in spirit :)
            <br/>Until next year...
