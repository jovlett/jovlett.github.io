        This design can be used on a Kurt machine vise or a T-slotted table to position stock repeatably. It's pretty sick!<br/>
        The original concept (below) was only going to have one link, but I added another for flexibility:
        </p>
        <div class="image-row">
            <div class="image-row-item"><img src="assets/projects/multi-axis-hardstop/1.png"></div>
            <div class="image-row-item"><img src="assets/projects/multi-axis-hardstop/2.png"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
        Tightening bolts on each joint should lock it together. There's a little hole+keyed tab for the stop rod that clamps onto the rod when the screw is tight to hopefully not mar it up. It's also modular which is nice. If needed, I can make more links for even more reach.
        <br/><br/>To be machined soon!
        </p>
